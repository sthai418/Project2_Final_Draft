# Project2_Final_Draft
This is the final draft from Project2D.

Scientific Question: There are currently two primary vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 from infecting humans, how do the Moderna and Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines differ in mRNA sequence?

Hypothesis: If both Moderna and Pfizer are mRNA vaccines that code for spike protein, then if we compare the sequences used in the vaccines we can differentiate the similarities and differences between the vaccines.
